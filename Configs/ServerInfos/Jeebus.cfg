[Jeebus]
Jeebus strides slowly along the path, a twisted staff in hand, more for ceremony than support. His voice drifts like a chant caught between a hymn and a riddle, filled with warnings wrapped in half-truths. "All bonds break in time," he mutters to passing strangers, a faint smile curling under his hood. "Even the gods must bleed, and the clever survive where the strong fall." His tattered robes, once symbols of some long-dead faith, now bear the wear of endless wandering. He speaks of gods both known and forgotten, weaving Loki’s wisdom into every word: “What is gained by honor, when deceit wins the prize?” Some say Thane’s gaze slips between this world and the next, catching glimpses of fates yet unwoven. Others whisper that he walks in exile, cursed to roam until the truth itself turns to ash on his tongue. Wherever he goes, his voice lingers long after he’s gone—like a trick played too well, and only half-understood.
