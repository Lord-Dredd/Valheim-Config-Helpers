[Welcome]
<color=red>The Lands of Dredd Valheim Server</color>

<color=cyan>A realm of Vikings, monsters, and the occasional misplaced mob, where vigilance and camaraderie are essential. As we venture through these lands, let us support one another in our quests, and remember you can choose 2 Professions for extra skills points (Press P)</color>

<color=cyan>Most resources, such as crypts and dungeons, respawn regularly. Admins also replenish ores, silvers, tins, and other essential materials from time to time, ensuring new Vikings have the resources they need to thrive.</color>  

<color=cyan>While you venture, beware of magical zones, creatures may be harder or other unnatural things may be taking place, hover over an area on your map to see what buffs are present.</color>

<color=cyan>Coins are key in these realms, if you want to buy or even sell, you will need a sack full. You can sell items to the Trader at Dredd Hall, or collect coins in dungeons and crypts. If you think something should be in the Trader, mention it.</color>

<color=cyan>Our Bank boasts unlimited storage capacity, a treasure trove for all your needs. The Marketplace is the hub for buying and selling among Vikings. Remember to collect your items or coins from the Collection NPC (Mail) after each transaction in the marketplace.</color>

<color=cyan>Quests are a fantastic way to hone your skills, offering a variety of challenges.</color>

<color=cyan>For those seeking a challenge, we have an arena with an NPC who can summon monsters for you! Itâ€™s a great place for leveling and gear collecting, provided you're prepacyan for the battles ahead and have the coin to pay for the service.</color>

<color=cyan>In Discord, please change your Server Name to match your in-game name for easier identification. This can be done on a per-server basis, keeping your name consistent.</color>

<color=cyan>The V-Connect channel in Discord posts in-game information, such as server start/stop times and /s shouts from players.</color>

<color=cyan>I like to have a diologue with the Vikings, they need to tell me how the game feels, is it too hard, too easy, too much drops, time for a new run, mod requests... </color>

<color=cyan>Any suggestions issues or if you just want to shoot the ish, contact Lord Dredd AKA Merc and we will see what we can do. Its all about having fun, and camaraderie.</color>

<color=cyan>Good luck, and welcome to The Lands of Dredd!</color>
