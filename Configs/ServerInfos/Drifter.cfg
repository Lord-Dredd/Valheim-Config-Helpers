[drifter]

Alekke the Drifter moves with the ease of a man who’s lost everything and laughs at the thought of losing more. Cloaked in a patchwork of scavenged furs, he clinks with the sound of copper and silver rattling in pouches hidden beneath his belt. His eyes gleam like freshly-cast runes—forever hunting the next bet, the next thrill, or the next fool willing to tempt fate. From the moment he steps through the spawn’s mist-laden woods to the heart of the village, he hums a tune known only to the damned. "All it takes is one good hand," he’ll say with a sly grin, "and a man can bind his fate or break it." Whether fortune smiles or curses his name, Alekke walks ever onward, as if chased by the ghosts of wagers lost.
