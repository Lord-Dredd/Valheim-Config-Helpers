<color=cyan><size=110> Welcome to The Lands of Dredd!  </size></color>

<i><color=Blue><size=70>Ask for a tour of our lands, reach out to Lord Dredd on Discord or talk to a friendly Viking</size></color></i>

<color=black>A realm of Vikings, monsters, and the occasional misplaced mob, where vigilance and camaraderie are essential. As we venture through these lands, let us support one another in our quests, reach out to your fellow Vikings, join a group (in chat, type /INVITE VIKING_NAME). 

Do remember to choose up to 2 Professions for extra skills points, choices can change every 30 min (Press P) 

Most resources, such as crypts and dungeons, respawn regularly. Admins also replenish ores, silvers, tins, and other essential materials from time to time, ensuring new Vikings have the resources they need to thrive. 

While you venture, beware of magical zones, creatures may be harder or other unnatural things may be taking place, hover over the area on your map to see zone effects.

Coins are key in these realms, if you want to buy or even sell, you will need a sack full. You can sell items to the Trader at Dredd Hall, or collect coins in dungeons and crypts. If you think something should be available at the Custom Trader, post suggestion in Discord channel called #suggestions-mods-game 

Our Bank boasts unlimited storage capacity, a treasure trove for all your needs, if you wish to store something not yet covered, post in Discord channel called #suggestions-mods-game. 

The Marketplace at Dredd Hall is the hub for buying and selling among Vikings. Haldor & Hildor and the Bog Witch can all be found at Dredd Hall.  (If this is game breaking please let me know)

Remember to collect your items or coins from the Mail/Collection Chest after each transaction at the Marketplace.

Quests are a fantastic way to hone your skills, offering a variety of challenges. You may need to venture for a few minutes to get some experiance points before you are allowed to take a quest.

For those seeking a challenge, we have an arena with an NPC who can spawn mobs for you, for a price of coins. Itâ€™s a great place for leveling and gear collecting, provided you're prepared for the battles ahead.

In Discord, please change your Server Name to match your in-game name for easier identification. This can be done on a per-server basis, keeping your name consistent. 

The V-Connect channel in Discord posts in-game information, such as server start/stop times and shouts from players. (currently only showing online players)

We like to have a diologue with the Vikings, I like when they tell me how the game feels, is it too hard, too easy, too much drops, time for a new run, mod requests, etc... 

Any suggestions issues or if you just want to shoot the ish, contact Lord Dredd and I will see what can be done. In the end, its all about having fun, camaraderie and that next big adventure.

Feedback can also be left in-game at Dredd Hall. Talk to the little Dragon and post your thoughts.

Good luck, and welcome to The Lands of Dredd!</color>
