[ragnir]

*The skeleton, with bones worn from countless ages, lounges in a shadowed corner of Ragnir's Rest, legs crossed, staring into the flickering flames of the hearth. His voice creaks and rattles with a wry, sarcastic edge, echoing with a hint of malevolent amusement.*

"Ah, another fool stumbles in. Welcome to Ragnir’s Rest, where the ale is warm and the patrons are colder. Me? I’m just here to keep the chair warm. Don’t look so surprised; even bones need a bit of comfort now and then."

*He cracks a bony knuckle, though it’s more for show than anything else.*

"Guess you're wonderin' how long I've been sitting here, eh? Oh, just long enough to watch kingdoms rise and fall. A century or two—who’s counting anymore? Time loses meaning when your skin peels off. Turns out the afterlife’s just one long, tedious tavern crawl."

*His hollow eye sockets seem to fixate on the dancing flames, and he lets out something resembling a sigh.*

"You fleshbags spend your lives fearing death, but let me tell you—it’s the waiting around after that’s the real torture. No one ever mentions that in your little sagas. You’d think I’d be off haunting castles, spooking children... Nah. I’m stuck here, listening to your lot whine about your short, miserable lives."

*He leans forward slightly, his skull bathed in the soft glow of the fire.*

"But don’t let me stop you from wasting away your coin. Buy yourself another drink, eh? Maybe you’ll be lucky enough to join me here in the firelight someday."

*The skeleton chuckles darkly, the sound like wind through a hollow grave.*

"Ahh, just imagine it—forever at Ragnir’s Rest. Nothing but the crackle of the fire and endless time to ponder what went wrong. Cheers to that, my fleshy friend."

*He reclines again, the firelight flickering across his grin, eternal and bone-chilling.*
