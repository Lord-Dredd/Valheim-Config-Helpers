Rules for the Starter Village
	- No WARDS ALLOUD
	- No stealing from other houses
	- When using any workbench, material is pulled from chests, be wary that you dont use other peoples stuff when crafting

Look for a place to lay your head, some houses may be occupied, if the bed has a name its likely taken. 	

You may build in the Village, but builds must stay small.

If your moving out please destroy your bed and make a new one for the next Viking.
