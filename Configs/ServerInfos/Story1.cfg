[Story1]

Beneath the blood-red sky of The Land's of Dredd, a long-abandoned village rots under the weight of forgotten horrors. The skeletal remains of its people lay scattered, frozen in grotesque shapes of agony. For in the final days of the plague, they were not taken by sickness alone. No, something far worse stalked the night — Draugr, ancient warriors, risen from their cairns, drawn by the stench of fear and decay. Their hollow eyes gleamed with the hunger for flesh, their dead hands dripping with the blood of the innocent. The villagers’ cries were drowned in the thunder of their arrival, their lives snuffed out before the dawn.

Yet, even now, the land hungers. The Draugr's curse lingers, festering in the soil, waiting for the next fool to claim these forsaken lands. Wanderers say the earth itself whispers your name, Lord Dredd, bidding your servants to claim the throne of ruin. But beware, for those who seek the power of the dead may soon find their own flesh rotting, their souls chained forever to the cursed earth beneath their feet.
